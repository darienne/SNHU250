# SNHU 250 Final
The final project for CS-250 centered on a Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel Site, developed throughout the course to simulate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) within an Agile/Scrum framework. Throughout the project, we rotated through key Scrum roles—Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, and Tester—to gain a comprehensive understanding of each position’s responsibilities and impact.

User stories played a pivotal role in guiding development. As Product Owners, we crafted and refined these stories to define clear, actionable features. Developers used them to focus their efforts, while Testers translated them into precise test cases to validate functionality and reliability.

Our development process closely followed the Scrum methodology, including:

Gathering and refining input from users and stakeholders

Translating feedback into user stories and test cases

Building features using industry-standard coding practices and maintaining open communication

Continuously testing, reporting bugs, and updating test documentation

Conducting sprint reviews and retrospectives to reflect, adapt, and improve

This iterative approach taught me how to navigate shifting requirements and unexpected challenges while maintaining strong communication and organizational discipline—key traits of an effective team member.

Additionally, we explored a variety of Agile tools to support our workflow, including Kanban boards, project management platforms like Asana and Trello, and sprint tracking tools such as Zoho and Jira. These resources enhanced our ability to plan, track, and collaborate efficiently throughout the development cycle.
